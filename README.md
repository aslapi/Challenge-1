# Horiseon Code Refactor LaPierre

## Description

Horiseon is a company that is looking to inform other companies and organizations about how to market their own information on the internet. This project was simply a code refactor to clean up some of the lengthy unneeded code. This code refactor used semantic HTML tags so it's easier to read and track for those working on the code. The refactor consolidated CSS classes and reordered them so that they follow the semantic tagging in the HTML file.

I learned how to pick and choose which types of HTML sematic tags to use, how CSS classes can be brought together for a cleaner code, and how to consistently commit changes and leave detailed descriptions of what I did so myself or others can track the progress.

## Purpose

The purpose of this refactor was to make the website code cleaner and easier to read as well as make the website meet accessibility standards by using alt tags for images.
